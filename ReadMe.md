# Code Contest Template
This project allows you to scaffold out a useful framework for organizing and solving coding challenges.

I've designed it in mind with:
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
* [Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes/home)
* [I18N Puzzles](https://i18n-puzzles.com/)
* [Codyssi](https://www.codyssi.com/)

You'll be asked to fill out information needed to scaffold out the project.

## Setup
1. If not already installed, install [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
1. Run the program
   - If using Visual Studio or VSCode, use the play button to build and run the code
   - If using a terminal, run `dotnet run` from the repo's base folder
1. You will be prompted for inputs, but you can bypass these by setting default values in the `Program.cs` file.
1. Review the code for correctness and update any commented TODOs

## Notes
This code is not robust and doesn't handle/validate all possible cases and inputs
